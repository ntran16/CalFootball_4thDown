    "Our goal will be to maximize the expected value of the decision to go for it, punt, or kick a field goal.  This means we need to compute the following quantities:\n",
    "\n",
    " + Expected Possession Value (EPV): the value, in points, of a first down at any location on the field.  Kickoffs will also require an expected value.\n",
    " + Probability of making a 4th down conversion given a location on the field, eg. how likely a team is to make a 4th and 3 conversion from the opponent 47 yard line.  We can use this with EPV to quantify the expected value of going for the first down.\n",
    " + Expected net punt distance given a location on the field.  Coupled with EPV, this quantifies the expected value of punting.\n",
    " + Probability of making a field goal from a given distance, eg. how likely it is to make a 45 yard field goal.  Combined with the EPV for field location and kickoffs, we can compute an expected value of kicking the field goal by estimating the likelihood and expected value of a miss or a make.\n",
    " \n",
    "These 4 quantities can be combined to produce expected value of going for the first down, punting, or kicking the field goal.  Our decision rule will be to choose the option that maximizes expected value.  The model we will build is a baseline \"average\" model that can be used as a starting point before factoring in issues like quality of field goal kicker, offense or defense quality, or weather.\n",

    "1. Isolate kickoffs by using PlayType. \n",
    "2. Drill down by GameID and Drive # (ignoring kickoffs) and take the first play of the drive.  We need to ignore kickoffs and extra points because those can both appear as the first play of a drive.  This will pollute our results if we do not ignore them.\n",
    "3. Find the next score in the game for each possession.  This is the hardest computation.  We do this by computing differences in the home and away scores and then fill those backward.  We treat home scores as positive and away scores as negative.  We only consider possession value within a half.  So if there is no score before halftime or the end of the game, the value is 0.\n",
    "4. Compute possession value.  We multiply the next score value by +1 or -1 depending on if the current possessing team is the home team or away team.  If its the home team, then multiply by +1 because the next score is already oriented to the home team.  If its the away team, then multiply by -1 because a positive next score is a negative for the away team.\n",
    "5. Restrict possessions to the first and third quarter to avoid end of half/game effects like settling for points at the end of the first half or playing to win at the end of the game.\n",
